# ETF-Analyzer

### Project Description
This is a simple Python program that compares the performance of an ETF over a short (1 year) and long (10 years) time period. The objective is to teach people that in the long run the market always tends to increase in value. Thus, if one has a long investment timeframe, it's sensible to consistently dollar cost average into a low cost, broad-market ETF/index fund and let compound interest do its magic.
